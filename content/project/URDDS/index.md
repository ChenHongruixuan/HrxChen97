title: "Urban Road Defect Detection System Based on Deep Learning"
summary: "In this project, we designed and established the framework of the urban road defect detection system. This system can collect road video data and coresponding GPS trajectory data. A deep learning model is applied to recognize the road defect situaion according to the video data. The detection results can be drawn in the map according to GPS data."
