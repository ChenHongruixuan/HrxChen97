Hello, I am CHEN Hongruixuan, welcome to my personal website. My Life motto is: where of what’s past is prologue.

I am currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. My current research fields include deep learning, domain adaptation, image processing (including remote sensing data and natural images), and change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing image. Welcome to send emails to me for discussing academic problems related to deep learning, computer vision, image processing, and remote sensing. 

In my spare time, I would read books, watch movies and anime, play PC games and work out. My favorite writers are J.R.R. Tolkien, Gabriel García Márquez, and LIU Cixin. I watch different kinds of movies, but the ones that fascinate me the most are The Lord of the Rings, The Legend of 1900, and Schindler’s List. As for games, open-world games, such as The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher 3, and NieR: Automata, are my favorites. If you are also interested in the above works, welcome to contact me. Let us share the elation brought by these great works.

Now, the further pursuit of knowledge makes me an enthusiastic applicant for doctoral programs.
